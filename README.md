# Fractal Technical Interviews - Questions

This repository contains the questions to the different technical interview questions that we administer or have administered in the past here at Fractal. Each folder contains one interview question, with its associated README for directions and where the starter code contains blank statements where the candidate must provide work.

The associated interview solutions repository is located [here](https://github.com/fractalcomputers/interview-solutions).

## Administering a Technical Interview

When administering a technical interview, please select the question you want from this repository, add it to a brand new, private Fractal repo, and give access to the candidate. Make sure to remove access at the end of the interview period, and to delete the temporary repository once the interview notes have been collected and compiled.

## Creating a Technical Interview Question

If you would like to create a technical interview question, you should feel free to do so. You can base yourself off of the existing questions to get an understanding of the structure. Once you have a question and you have developped a solution, you should make a pull request on the interview-solutions repository so that 2 other Fractal engineers can attempt the question themselves and judge its difficulty. If it is deemed difficult enough to assess strong technical candidates, the solution can be added to the solutions repository as a subfolder, and the question can be added to this repository.
