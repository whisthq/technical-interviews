# Fractal Technical Interviews - Questions

This repository contains the questions to the different technical interview questions that we administer or have administered in the past here at Fractal. Each folder contains one interview question with its associated README for directions and where the starter code contains blank statements where the candidate must provide work.

The associated interview solutions repository is located [here](https://github.com/fractalcomputers/interview-solutions).

## Administering a Technical Interview

When administering a technical interview, please select the question you want from this repository, add it to a brand new, private Fractal repository, and give access to the candidate. Make sure to remove access at the end of the interview period, and to delete the temporary repository once the interview notes have been collected and compiled. You should collect interview notes in the Notion, under the `Interview Notes` shared workspace. If you don't have access to this shared workspace, you should contact Phil.

## Creating a Technical Interview Question

If you would like to create a technical interview question, you should feel free to do so. You can base it off of the existing questions to get an understanding of the structure. Once you have a question and you have developped a solution, you should make a pull request on this repository so that 2 other Fractal engineers can attempt the question themselves and judge its difficulty. If it is deemed difficult enough to assess strong technical candidates, the question can be added here as a subfolder and the solution can be added to the `interview-solutions` repository.
